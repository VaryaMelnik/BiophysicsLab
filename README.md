# Model of filtration and reabsorption processes in capillaries

This code helps to model one of the mechanisms of substance transfer through the capillary wall, namely, the filtration-reabsorption mechanism of transport of substances together with the liquid under the influence of a pressure gradient.

## Results of modelling

### Analytical solutions to the equation of the model of filtration and reabsorption processes in capillaries for various values of the parameter `r` (pore radius on the capillary surface)

### Analytical solutions of the equation of the model of filtration and reabsorption processes in capillaries for variable values of the parameter `Pa` (hydrostatic pressure at the arterial end of the capillary)
