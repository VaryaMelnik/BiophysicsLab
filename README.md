# Model of filtration and reabsorption processes in capillaries

This code helps to model one of the mechanisms of substance transfer through the capillary wall, namely, the filtration-reabsorption mechanism of transport of substances together with the liquid under the influence of a pressure gradient.

## Results of modelling

### Analytical solutions to the equation of the model of filtration and reabsorption processes in capillaries for various values of the parameter r (pore radius on the capillary surface)

### Analytical solutions of the equation of the model of filtration and reabsorption processes in capillaries for variable values of the parameter Pa (hydrostatic pressure at the arterial end of the capillary)
