# Model of filtration and reabsorption processes in capillaries

This code helps to model one of the mechanisms of substance transfer through the capillary wall, namely, the filtration-reabsorption mechanism of transport of substances together with the liquid under the influence of a pressure gradient.

## Results of modelling

### Analytical solutions to the equation of the model of filtration and reabsorption processes in capillaries for various values of the parameter r (pore radius on the capillary surface).
